﻿// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to serialize DockLayoutManager using TabbedDocumentUIService
// 
// Some of DockLayoutManager’s panel groups can contain documents that were created
// from ViewModel with IDocumentManagerService. To serialize and restore them
// correctly, it is necessary to perform these steps:
// 
// 1. Create a style and set a
// name for DocumentPanel. To do this, bind DocumentPanel.BindableName to a unique
// property.
// 
// 2. Apply this style to all documents that will be created from
// ViewModel.
// 
// 3. Before serializing DockLayoutManager, serialize all documents
// created from ViewModel.
// 
// 4. Before restoring DockLayoutManager, recreate all
// documents created from ViewModel.
//
